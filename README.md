# Rivon

Rivon is a modern sports trading and betting exchange, where you can but football teams as stocks and trade them in real-time and also you can use those stocks to bet on live matches.The main idea behind this project is to build robust and super system with as much as automation as possible and efficient scalling methods .It is built with high-performance technologies. It features a scalable frontend architecture using Turborepo and Next.js, and a flexible backend infrastructure powered by Go.

## PLEASE NOTE !!! 
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. But please make sure try to completely fix the issue then raise a pr and also not forget to update the docs and readme files. If you are raising a pr for both client side and server side then please try to raise it together not forcing anything but this is for fullstack students so they will get better exposure . And please keep pr standards high and make sure to raise pr for small changes also.

## 🚀 Project Status

### Client-Side (Frontend)
The frontend is structured as a **Turborepo** monorepo containing:
- **Apps**:
  - `bet`: A Next.js 16 application for betting features.
  - `exchange`: A Next.js 16 application for exchange features.
- **Packages**:
  - Shared UI components (`@workspace/ui`).
  - Shared configurations (`eslint-config`, `typescript-config`).
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, TailwindCSS, TypeScript.

### Server-Side (Backend)
The backend is initialized as a **Go module** with a custom CLI tool for managing microservices.
- **CLI Tool**: Located in `Server/cli`, this tool helps in scaffolding, building, and starting services.
- **Services**:
  - `api-server`: The main API server built with `chi` router. It includes middleware for logging, recovery, and timeouts, and supports graceful shutdown.
- **Shared Internals**:
  - `config`: Centralized configuration management using `godotenv` to load environment variables.
- **Current State**: The infrastructure is set up with the first microservice (`api-server`) and shared configuration logic.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the application locally.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS recommended)
- **pnpm** (Package manager)
- **Go** (v1.24+)

### 1. Client Setup (Frontend)

Navigate to the `Client` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd Client
bun install
```

To start the development server for all apps:

```bash
bun dev
```

Or to run a specific app (e.g., `bet`):

```bash
bun --filter bet dev
```

### 2. Server Setup (Backend)

Navigate to the `Server` directory:

```bash
cd Server
```

#### Environment Configuration
Copy the sample environment file and configure the necessary variables:
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```
Ensure the following variables are set in `.env`:
- `AUTH_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `API_SERVER_URL`

#### Managing Services

The backend is managed via a custom CLI tool located in `cli/main.go`.

**Add a new service:**
This will create a new service directory in `cmd/<service-name>`.
```bash
go run cli/main.go add <service-name>
# Example: go run cli/main.go add auth
```

**Start services:**
Starts all registered services (defined in `services.json`).
```bash
go run cli/main.go start
# Or start specific services:
# go run cli/main.go start api-server
```

**Build services:**
Builds binaries for the services into the `bin/` directory.
```bash
go run cli/main.go build
```
